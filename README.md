# Notation
This game uses the Numpad Notation for move commands.
Directions are written as numbers, and buttons as letters.
A sequence of numbers indicate a motion you make with the D-Pad or Stick.
All commands assume your character is facing right. Invert the horizontal commands if your character is facing left.
Most moves can be done both in the ground or in the air. They have (on ground) or (in air) if they can't.

# Game System
## HP
HP, short for Hit Points, is a vital resource in this game.

You start with maximum HP. If your HP is reduced to zero, your character is knocked out, and you lose.

To prevent HP loss, you can do a number of things, including but not limited to:
- Guard against attacks, greatly reducing the damage taken. The remaining damage is what we call "chip damage".
- Parry attacks, which, while risky, prevents all damage, and gives you plenty of advantages.
- Dodge attacks, either by being far away, dodging them with movement, or spending TP on TP Dodges/Teleports.

Some characters have abilities that drain or heal their own HP. Goku's Kaioken is an example of a technique that harms both the user and the target.

Some characters have abilities that drain the enemy's HP, healing their own in the process.

Rarely, some characters have abilities that can heal their own HP or an ally's.

In extremely rare cases, some characters have abilities that can bring someone from zero HP back to life.

## MP
MP, known as Meter/Mana Points, are your primary offensive resource.
Your character's Mana, Ki, Chakra, Spirit or Energy, is represented by their MP.

You start with zero MP, and you can have a maximum of 10 MP.

You can gain MP by:
- Attacking
- Defending
- Using MP Charge.

To spend MP, you can use several of your character's moves to do so.
If you don't have enough MP, you can't use moves that require that MP.
Most commonly, Supers and Ultimates/Finishers spend the most MP.
Some Special moves, and even some Unique moves, spend MP in some way.

## TP
Tech Points, or TP for short, is your primary mobility and defensive resource.

You start with a maximum of 4 TP, and you regenerate lost TP over time.

TP regenerates slowly, so be careful about how you use it.

TP can be used to teleport a short distance in any direction, or to dodge attacks.
TP Dodges teleport you behind your opponent, so you can attempt a quick counterattack before they turn around to block.

Certain Special moves can use TP to increase the distance covered, so make sure to have some spare TP when you can.

## XP
XP, or Experience Points, are this game's primary mechanic, alongside LVL.

You start with zero XP, and XP is measured in percentages (%).

XP can be gained in several ways.
Attacking and defending are the primary XP gain methods.

XP can also be gained by performing an MP Charge with Max MP. This is called an XP Charge.
When you have Max XP, maintaining your XP Charge will result in a Level Up.

### Levels
Levels, or LVL, is a measurement of how powerful your character is.

You start at Level 1, and can go up to Level 5.

To increase your level, you must Level Up. To Level Up, you must perform a XP Charge with Max XP.

The higher your level, the more damage you deal with your attacks, and the less damage you take from enemy attacks.
Most characters also become faster with each Level Up, increasing mobility and attack speed.

### Transformations
Transformations, or Transforms, are a system which is tied to the Level Up system.

Certain characters can transform when Leveling Up, which changes their moveset and abilities.

Some characters have multiple forms they can take when transforming. You can hold Up or Down to choose one of the alternate forms.
You can also transform by using the Undo/Redo Transform commands. This assumes you have transformed before.
